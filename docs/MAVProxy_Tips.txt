If you are making a new module use the other modules as an example
To install the new module follow these steps:
    1. run "python your_module.py" (make sure your module compiles)
    2. cd to root of MAVProxy repo (should contain setup.py)
    3. Run "sudo python setup.py build"
    4. Run "sudo python setup.py install"
    5. Repeat 4 (I get errors on the first try but its works on the second. IDK)
