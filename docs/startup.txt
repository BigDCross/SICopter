Start up Script for the onbaord computer:

After cloning the repo, you will need to add a script to the main users .bashrc.
This should be located in the users home folder.

The script will check what tty the user is logging into, if it is tty1, then it will start the script.
This means on startup, since the first shell is tty1, the user will be automaticlly logged in and the script will start.
If you need to use tty1 then you can ctrl-c out and use the terminal. If possible, using another tty or ssh would be a good idea.
Other terminals and ssh will not automatically start the sctipt, only tty1 will do that.

Lines to add to .bashrc:

echo -n "checking tty: "
echo $(tty)
if [ $(tty) = "/dev/tty1" ]; then
    ~/SI/SICopter/Start_Mavproxy.sh
fi
